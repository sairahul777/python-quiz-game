# üß† True or False Quiz Game in Python

A simple console-based quiz game built in Python where users answer true/false questions and get scored in real time. It tests your knowledge with fun facts and keeps track of your score!

---

## üìå Features

- Asks a series of true/false questions
  
- Accepts user input (`true` or `false`) in any letter case
  
- Checks answers and provides immediate feedback
  
- Tracks and displays current score after each question
  
- Shows final score at the end of the quiz
  
- Uses Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) with `Question` and `QuizBrain` classes for clean code structure

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Python 3:** Programming language used for building the project.
  
- **OOP Concepts:** Classes, objects, methods, and encapsulation.
  
- **Console I/O:** To interact with the user via terminal input and output.
  
- **Control Flow:** Loops and conditionals to manage quiz progression and validations.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

1. Make sure Python 3 is installed on your system.  
2. Save the code in a file named `quiz_game.py` (or any name you prefer).  
3. Run the script from your terminal or command prompt
4. Answer the questions by typing `True` or `False` (case insensitive).  
5. Enjoy the quiz and track your score!
